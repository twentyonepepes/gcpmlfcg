    definition : > 
      In a binary classification, a number between 0 and 1 that converts the raw output of a logistic regression model into a prediction of either the positive class or the negative class.


      A logistic regression model outputs a raw value between 0 and 1. Then:

      1. If this raw value is greater than the classification threshold, then the positive class is predicted.

      2. If this raw value is less than the classification threshold, then the negative class is predicted.

      A metric representing a model's loss against the test set. When building a model, you typically try to minimize test loss. 
      
      
      That's because a low test loss is a stronger quality signal than a low training loss or low validation loss.


      A large gap between test loss and training loss or validation loss sometimes suggests that you need to increase the regularization rate.

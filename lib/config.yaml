  - name : Linear Regression
    short : for predicting numerical  labels
    categories:
      - Statistics
    definition: >
      A type of machine learning model in which both of the following are true:
        - The model is a linear model.
        - The prediction is a floating-point value. (This is the regression part of linear regression.)

      Contrast linear regression with logistic regression. Also, contrast regression with classification.
